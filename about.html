   <!-- <h1 style="font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; text-align:center"><span>WELCOME TO TRUMPET SOUND ACADEMY </span></h1><br>-->
    
    <p > Trumpet Sound Academy (TSA) uses mainly the Accelerated Christian Education (ACE) School of Tomorrow curriculum and inculcates the Nigerian curriculum to bridge all gap topics and subjects. This makes the school unique, as its approach is not conventional.  It places emphasis on learning rather than teaching and a great deal is done to recognize and motivate individual pupils. Very close co-operation with parents is encouraged and expected, hence, much responsibility for the training and education of children is placed on the School as well as with the parents</p><br>
    
    <span style="font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; color:#F00"> THE PURPOSE OF THE SCHOOL</span><br>
    <p>The school aims at providing the most excellent standard of education that will lay the solid foundation for the spiritual, moral, socio-cultural development and academic advancement of the students. We focus on making consecrated hearts, educated minds and equipped hands. This will enable the students to develop character, especially in respecting godly principles and enjoying a daily walk with God here and in the hereafter.</p>
    
    <span style="font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; color:#F00"> THE OBJECTIVES</span><br>
    The overall aim of establishing Trumpet Sound Academy is achieved through its ability to: 
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
    <li> Implement modern high-tech, individualized curriculum and learning procedures</li>
    <li> 	Introduce and reinforce good family and biblical values that will increase personal responsibility, character development, and positive citizenship.</li>
    <li> 	Reduce the rate of school dropouts and failures through academic safety nets and quality control.</li>
    <li> 	Increase social awareness of educational reform.</li>
    <li> 	Inculcate in students the acumen to set and achieve goals, being faithful and truthful in their dealings.</li>
    <li> 	Raise the literacy level of Nigeria.</li>
    </ol><br>
    <span style="font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; color:#F00">THE SCHOOL SYSTEM</span>
    <p>Trumpet Sound Academy strives at achieving excellence in character and academics 	using godly principles through the following elements:</p><br>
    <span style="font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; color:#F00">Individualized Learning</span>
    <p>Learning system in TSA is individualized and designed to allow each student to work at his own level of achievement, which may vary from subject to subject. The core curriculum is a high-tech state-of-the-art curriculum package.</p><br>
    <span style="font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; color:#F00">Individualized Diagnosis and Prescription</span>
    <p>The individualized learning system is employed as a medium of learning, as such, the ACE Diagnostic tests is administered on every new entrant into the system to determine the performance level for each subject. Thereafter learning is achieved at the pace of the learner; however, with strong motivation by the supervisor</p><br>
    <span style="font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; color:#F00"> Goal and Control</span>
    <p>Goal setting is basic to student’s success.  Students are trained and allowed to set reasonable learning goals that can be achieved in a prescribed period of time.  It gives pupils the responsibility for learning by ensuring they learn to plan their work and set achievable daily goals.  Students are trained to see daily assignments as steps necessary to maintain continuous progress, which is part of a life-training process.  However, the emphasis is on how much a student can accomplish each day and not so much he can accomplish each year.</p><br>
    <span style="font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; color:#F00">Prescribed Curriculum</span>
    <p>Each student is assigned a curriculum according to guidelines. The Core Curriculum consists of Mathematics (including Quantitative Reasoning), English Studies (including Verbal Reasoning, Phonetics and all other aspects of English), Social Studies, Science, Word Building, Literature and Creative Writing. Others include computer studies, French (and other languages), Civic, Physical and Health Education. In the first six levels of core curriculum, the student is introduced to God and His creation.  Through this frame of reference, many facts about the world and the universe are presented.  Science teaches about God’s physical creation, Social Studies present the world as ruled and ordered by God and History as “His Story”.  Mathematics presents facts about God’s orderly world.  English teaches the student the importance of communication in living for God.  Word Building, Literature and Creative Writing reinforce communication skills and provide practice for improved vocabulary and word usage. All PACEs/workbooks have been harmoniously developed to give the student academic balance that enable a learner from TSA a ready instrument to perfectly fit into any further studies anywhere in the world. The training also reveal to the learners God’s point of view concerning Himself, the Student, and the World.  Such orientation is essential in training children to be accountable to the living God.</p><br>
    <span style="font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; color:#F00"> Staff, Students and Educational PROGRAMMES</span>
    <p>The School has Academic Supervisors and Non-teaching Staff who are trained locally and internationally in both the ACE and Nigerian Educational Curriculum. They are very efficient and effective in handling the students of the school. 
The students of the school are grouped into seven categories with the programmes/Centres hereinafter enumerated.</p><br>
<span style="font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; color:#F00">Child Care</span>
<p>The Child Care (CC) centre caters for children between 6months and less than 2 years. Audio-visuals and toys are used in the learning centre to reinforce learning. </p><br>
<span style="font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; color:#F00">Step-By-Step</span>
<p>The Step-by-Step is a structured Early Childhood Development (ECD) curriculum that assists the ECD practitioner in presenting specific day-to-day lessons within a framework that encourages personal growth. This exciting life skills programme is for active young learners in the 2-3/4 year old age group. Themes and Hand-on activities present simple informative ideas for each theme</p><br>
<span style="font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; color:#F00">Reading Preparatory (Basic) Programme</span>
<p>The Reading Basic (RB) programme caters for pupils within the 3-4 age brackets. Each theme of the RB programme cover a 3-week work and includes at least 15 lessons detailing videos and day-to-day Stories (many divided into 2 parts) and hand-on events/activities. There are also illustrations for the children to colour and many Creative Activities. This centre prepares the pupil through all alphabets (capital and small letters) and numeracy </p><br>
<span style="font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; color:#F00">The Reading Programmes</span>
<p>The reading programmes trains the child to read. The Reading Readiness (RR) Programme also known as the Pre-School with Ace and Christi is a full year programme designed to develop the basic skills which prepare a child to be ready to “Learn to Read”. Cartoon animal songs and stories, 60 PACEs, Physical Development Activities,  and Bible and character-building stories are employed to foster learning of the letter sounds; to encourage understanding of number concepts and word relationships; to strengthen memory, visual, auditory, and coordination skills; and to build Biblical Character Traits. However, advanced pupils from the RB centres move directly to the “Learning to Read” Programme. The Learning-to-Read (LR) programme is meant for children who score 80% or above on the Pre-School Basic Readiness Test. It is also called the A B Cs with Ace and Christi Programme. The LR Programme is a phonetic skills package that dovetails into the School of Tomorrow PACE curriculum. The Programme utilizes a number of outstanding reading tools- a specially developed alphabet sequence, songs for each of the sounds, poems, displays, and physical activities. Additionally, there are character development activities and Bible stories built into the programme. The programme is designed to be used in conjunction with Word Building PACEs 1001-1012 and Maths PACEs 1001-1012. The LR programme takes about 12 to 15 weeks.</p><br>

<span style="font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; color:#F00">Main Learning Programme</span>
<p>Each core curriculum level course consists of 12 PACEs at the main level of learning. Normally, a student will complete a minimum of 72 PACEs in one academic year, however, this varies according to the student’s ability. The core curriculum at the individualized learning level includes the six basic academic disciplines that provide a student’s essential educational needs: Mathematics, English, Science, Social Studies, World Building, Literature and Creative Writing. Other Gap topics and subjects (as well as remedial courses) and expanded curriculum (Bible Reading, Animal Science, Nigerian Gap subjects) are included in training the pupils as the need arises. The average and brighter students who are able to complete the core curriculum quickly and need an extra challenge (from grade 2 to 8) are administered the TSA Expanded Curriculum.</p><br>
<span style="font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; color:#F00"> After School Care</span>
<p>The After School Care (ASC) programme is for children with busy parents. This enables the students to be kept under the watchful eyes of supervisors after the normal closing time. The supervisors engage the students with academics and other social events at a very minimal token. This is optional.</p><br>
<span style="font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; color:#F00">Adult Education</span>
<p>This is for adults who primarily want to learn to read and write. The academy runs the ACE ABCs with Ace and Christi Programme on them at fixed period. This has proved very effective over the years.</p><br>
<span style="font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; color:#F00">Computer Education, Student Offices and Excursions</span>
<p>The School emphasizes the use of electronic learning techniques especially computers in all its forms. This introduces the students to the basics of research. Students are therefore exposed to latest forms of learning with no prior computer experience required. At TSA each student is provided with an office to provide maximum privacy and effectiveness in the main learning centres (MLC). The purpose of the individual office is to minimize distractions and permit the student to focus on responsibilities. Pupils of TSA, under guidance of their supervisors; embark on excursion every term (except for the challenge of CoVid 19). This serve as field trips with all the learning experiences the pupils enjoy.</p>
